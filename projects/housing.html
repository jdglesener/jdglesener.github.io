            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                During our final semester of undergraduate studies, my classmates 
                and I undertook the creation of a comprehensive housing market dashboard to
                aid in navigating the post-college housing landscape. 
                Our primary aim was to develop a tool that would provide invaluable insights into housing options, particularly in Salem. 
                Leveraging RapidAPI, we meticulously scraped real estate data encompassing properties for sale, sold listings, 
                and rental offerings.
                Ensuring data integrity and consistency, our process was managed within a Docker container setup. Subsequently,
                we implemented a robust data storage solution using PostgreSQL hosted on Railway, enabling real-time updates and 
                reliable data access.
                To empower users with actionable insights, we integrated this data with Power BI to craft an interactive dashboard. 
                This platform allows users to explore and filter housing options based on specific criteria, facilitating informed decisions 
                about renting or buying homes in Salem. Through this project, we honed skills in Power BI for dynamic visualizations, PostgreSQL 
                for database management, and ETL processes for seamless data integration, 
                positioning us to expand our dashboard's coverage statewide and refine its features based on user feedback and emerging market 
                trends.

            <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                During our final semester of undergraduate studies, 
                my classmates and I aimed to create a tool to help us navigate the housing market as we prepared to start our careers 
                and lives post-college. We wanted a dashboard that would provide insights into the best course of action regarding housing options.

            <h2>Solution:</h2>
            <h3 id="indent">Data Collection:</h3>
            <p id="indent">
                We scraped real estate data for properties that were for sale, sold, and for rent in Salem using RapidAPI.
                This data collection process was executed within a Docker container to ensure consistency and manageability.
            </p>
            <h3 id="indent">Data Storage:</h3>
            <p id="indent">
                The scraped data was live-dumped into a PostgreSQL database hosted by Railway, ensuring real-time updates and reliable data storage.
            </p>
            <h3 id="indent">Data Visualization:</h3>
            <p id="indent">
                We connected the PostgreSQL database to a Power BI report, enabling us to create an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.
                The dashboard displays various housing options and their costs, 
                allowing users to filter based on features they desire and easily find available properties in Salem.
                This dashboard helps users, including ourselves, 
                to make informed decisions about renting or buying homes in Salem based on up-to-date market data.
