            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                Football, like many other sports, is continually being affected by the constant advances in technology. 
                Football is a game where you do not have many opportunities to prove yourself. There are on average 150 plays in every NFL game. 
                Once you account for special teams, offense and defense have 60-70 plays each, per game. 60-70 opportunities to prove mastery of the plays youâ€™ve practiced hundreds of times during the week leading to the game. 
                Having so few opportunities in a game, making the most of practices and film sessions is of the utmost importance. 
                One of the biggest issues in modern scouting and planning systems is that it is difficult to mentally translate from 2d game film to the football field.

                Our Goal with this project was to create a tool in Unreal Engine that a coach could use and share with players.
                This tool allows a user to draw out plays and then run them in a 3d environment with an offense and a defense.
                The user can also run a play from a players point of view so that they get a first person view of the play.

            <h2>Problem:</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                Spending practice time on scouting other teams is often tedious and time-consuming.
                Can we create a way that teams could practice plays and take 1st person mental reps to preserve time in practice to be more meaningful?

            <h2>Solution:</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                We created an application that allows coaches to input a play with the traditional x's and o's style format and then play that application using Unreal Engine.
