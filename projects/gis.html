            <p id="indent">
                This project involved analyzing the relationship between population and 
                COVID-19 cases in King County. To achieve this, I sourced COVID-19 data 
                from the Washington State website and shapefile data for every city in 
                Washington. I ran a Python script to simplify the COVID-19 data to the 
                necessary variables and imported both datasets into QGIS. I filtered out 
                all towns except those in King County and created maps to demonstrate potential 
                spatial relationships between these two variables. Through this project, 
                I developed advanced skills in using QGIS to join data with CSV files and 
                create informative maps.

            <h2>Problem:</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                COVID-19 has had profound effects on populations worldwide. This project 
                aimed to explore how the number of cases varied with the population of each 
                city in King County, visualizing these variations through detailed maps.

                <h4>Data Collection</h3>
                    I downloaded COVID Data from the King County Website and shapefile data
                     from the State of Washington Website.
                <h4>Data Storage</h3>
                    I ran a Python script to simplify the COVID data to only the necessary 
                    variables as well as change the city names to combine with the shapefile data.
                <h4>Data Visualization</h3>
                    I used QGIS along with the coloring options to show different maps with different variables.
                <h4>Results</h4>
                    The analysis revealed that while the total number of COVID-19 cases was 
                    higher in Seattle due to its larger population, the city did not have the highest percentage of cases. Instead, more rural areas such as Issaquah and other southern King County cities exhibited a higher percentage of citizens who contracted COVID-19.
