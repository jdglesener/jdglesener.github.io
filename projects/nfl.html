            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                In this project, we aimed to explore the predictability of NFL play calling based on pre-snap factors. 
                By analyzing extensive play-by-play data using the NFLpy package in Python, 
                we sought to determine which factors most significantly influenced play-calling decisions and to identify if certain teams were more predictable than others. 
                Our goal was to leverage machine learning techniques to develop predictive models that could assist in anticipating the type of play an opponent might call.

            <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                My classmates and I set out to investigate the predictability of NFL play calling based on pre-snap factors.
                Our goal was to determine which factors most significantly influenced playcalling and to identify if certain teams were more predictable than others.
                To achieve this, we utilized the NFLpy package in Python to gather extensive play-by-play data.

            <h2>Solution:</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                To address our problem, we developed a series of Random Forest models using the Scikit-learn library in Python.
                 These models took various pre-snap variables as input and aimed to predict the type of play that would be called.
            </p>
            <h3 id="indent">The primary variables we focused on included:</h3>
            <div id="indent">
                <ul>
                    <li>Time left in the half</li>
                    <li>Score</li>
                    <li>Down</li>
                    <li>Distance to the first down</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p id="indent">
                Additionally, we created models specific to individual teams to see if predictability varied from team to team. 
                Our models demonstrated an approximate 70% accuracy in predicting the next play type based on these situational pre-snap variables.
                This level of accuracy suggests that if an NFL team were to utilize our model, 
                they could reliably anticipate the opponent's play type 70% of the time,
                allowing them to optimize their defensive strategy accordingly.
