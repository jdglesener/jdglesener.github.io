            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                Our research focused on identifying potential relationships between the positions of stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell 
                (HR) diagram and the presence and number of exoplanets they host. 
                By utilizing data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (TESS Satellite) and the Gaia Archive (Data Release 2), 
                we analyzed a dataset of 1651 stars with projected exoplanets. 
                Our comprehensive approach included data collection, processing, and visualization. We sourced and merged the datasets, 
                ensuring accuracy and consistency, and created HR diagrams to visualize our findings. Our analysis revealed notable patterns, 
                such as the absence of white dwarfs with exoplanets and the challenges in detecting exoplanets around large, bright blue stars. 
                Throughout this project, we honed skills in Python programming, data merging, astrophysics concepts, and data analysis. 
                Moving forward, we plan to investigate individual outlier stars, conduct detailed statistical analyses, 
                update our dataset with the latest releases, and collaborate with experts in physics and astronomy to deepen our understanding 
                and refine our conclusions.

            <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                Our research aimed to determine if there is a discernible relationship between the location of stars on the Hertzsprung-Russell 
                (HR) diagram and the presence of exoplanets, as well as the number of exoplanets they may possess. 
                We utilized data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (TESS Satellite) and the Gaia Archive (Data Release 2), 
                encompassing a total of 34,250 projected exoplanets.

            <h2>Solution:</h2>
            <p id="indent">
                To explore this relationship, we undertook the following steps:
            </p>
            <h3 id="indent">Data Collection:</h3>
            <p id="indent">
                We sourced data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the Gaia Archive.
                Using the Gaia Archive search tool, we combined the star and exoplanet data, 
                resulting in a dataset of 1651 stars with exoplanets.
            </p>
            <h3 id="indent">Data Processing:</h3>
            <p id="indent">
                We counted the number of times each host star appeared using a dictionary data structure.
                We merged the two datasets, ensuring correct formatting and filtering out unnecessary columns.
            </p>        
            <h3 id="indent">Data Visualization:</h3>
            <p id="indent">
                We created HR diagrams using key parameters such as color (B band - R band) and absolute magnitude. 
                We initially created an HR diagram with all our stars.
                Subsequently, we divided the data into several number brackets to examine different patterns.
            </p>  
            <h3 id="indent">Results:</h3>
            <p id="indent">
                Our analysis revealed that there are no white dwarfs with exoplanets, likely due to post-supernova conditions.
                For large and bright blue stars, measurement challenges and strong gravitational forces may explain the absence
                of detected exoplanets.
